# How to run projects

The projects on this chapter rely on [Leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/wiki/Packaging) to run clojure scripts.

> ### Obs

> The link will redirects to package manager options, that I thought it would be the best installation option
>
> If you are on ubuntu I would recommend you to use [SDKMAN!](https://sdkman.io/sdks#leiningen) option
>
> If you are using vscode I would recommend you [clojure](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=avli.clojure), [clojure-code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jamesnorton.continuum) and [clojure-code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=williamlindsay.clojure-lint) extensions
>
> If you cant format your code see [this](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=avli.clojure#manual-configuration) article of that extension "clojure"

With everything set up:

Enter the project `cd ./FunctionalProgramming/<project-name>`
Run `lein repl`

This will starts a nREPL server that it listens the functions witten on the project.
